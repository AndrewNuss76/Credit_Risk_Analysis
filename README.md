# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to understand machine learning, using python, and how you can develop a model to predict instances such as credit risk.

## Results:
- Using the undersampling model, the balanced accuracy score was (insert) and the precision score was (insert)
